Can you believe it? Another project for Billy. It's almost like I have an addiction..

This project is a WIP, I am very aware I could make this in an actual Game Engine Environment, but I chose Winforms for the fun of it.

I'll create a compiled installed soon so you can take home and care for your very own BillyGochi!
